We use the `e1071` library in `R` to demonstrate the support vector classifier
and the SVM. Another option is the `LiblineaR` library, which is useful for
very large linear problems.

# Support Vector Classifier

The `e1071` library contains implementations for a number of statistical
learning methods. In particular, the `svm()` function can be used to fit a
support vector classifier when the argument `kernel="linear"` is used. A 
`cost` argument allows us to specify the cost of a violation to the margin. 
When the `cost` argument is small, then the margins will be wide and many 
support vectors will be on the margin or will violate the margin. 
When the `cost` argument is large, then the margins will be narrow and there 
will be few support vectors on the margin or violating the margin.

We now use the `svm()` function to fit the support vector classifier for a
given value of the `cost` parameter. Here we demonstrate the use of this
function on a two-dimensional example so that we can plot the resulting
decision boundary. We begin by generating the observations, which belong
to two classes.

```r
set.seed(1)
x <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 2), ncol = 2)
y <- rep(c(-1, 1), each = 10)
x[y == 1, ] <- x[y == 1, ] + 1
```

We begin by checking whether the classes are linearly separable.

```r
plot(x, col = (3 - y))
```

They are not. Next, we fit the support vector classifier. Note that in order
for the `svm()` function to perform classification (as opposed to SVM-based
regression), we must encode the response as a factor variable. We now
create a data frame with the response coded as a factor.

```r
library(e1071)
dat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y))
svmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, 
                   kernel = "linear", 
                     cost = 10,
                    scale = FALSE)
```

We can now plot the support vector classifier obtained:

```r
plot(svmfit, dat)
```

We can obtain some basic information about the support vector classifier
fit using the `summary()` command:

```r
summary(svmfit)
```

![](/img/svm04.png)

This tells us, for instance, that a linear kernel was used with `cost=10`, and
that there were seven support vectors, four in one class and three in the
other.

What if we instead used a smaller value of the cost parameter?

```r
svmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, 
                   kernel = "linear", 
                     cost = 0.1, 
                    scale = FALSE)
plot(svmfit, dat)
svmfit$index
summary(svmfit)
```

Now that a smaller value of the cost parameter is being used, we obtain a
larger number of support vectors, because the margin is now wider. Unfortunately,
the `svm()` function does not explicitly output the coefficients of
the linear decision boundary obtained when the support vector classifier is
fit, nor does it output the width of the margin.

The `e1071` library includes a built-in function, `tune()`, to perform crossvalidation.
By default, `tune()` performs ten-fold cross-validation on a set
of models of interest. In order to use this function, we pass in relevant
information about the set of models that are under consideration. The
following command indicates that we want to compare SVMs with a linear
kernel, using a range of values of the `cost` parameter.

```r
set.seed(1)
tune.out <- tune(svm, y ~ ., data = dat, 
                           kernel = "linear",
                           ranges = list(cost = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100)))
summary(tune.out)
```

![](/img/svm06.png)

We see that `cost=0.1` results in the lowest cross-validation error rate. The
`tune()` function stores the best model obtained, which can be accessed as
follows:

```r
bestmod <- tune.out$best.model
summary(bestmod)
```

The `predict()` function can be used to predict the class label on a set of
test observations, at any given value of the cost parameter. We begin by
generating a test data set.

```r
xtest <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 2), ncol = 2)
ytest <- sample(c(-1, 1), 20, rep = TRUE)
xtest[ytest == 1, ] <- xtest[ytest == 1, ] + 1
testdat <- data.frame(x = xtest, y = as.factor(ytest))
```

Now we predict the class labels of these test observations. Here we use the
best model obtained through cross-validation in order to make predictions.

```r
ypred <- predict(bestmod, testdat)
table(predict = ypred, truth = testdat$y)
```

Now consider a situation in which the two classes are linearly separable.
Then we can find a separating hyperplane using the `svm()` function. We
first further separate the two classes in our simulated data so that they are
linearly separable:

```r
x[y == 1, ] <- x[y == 1, ] + 0.5
plot(x, col = (y + 5) / 2, pch = 19)
```

![](/img/svm08.png)

Now the observations are just barely linearly separable. We fit the support
vector classifier and plot the resulting hyperplane, using a very large value
of `cost` so that no observations are misclassified.

```r
dat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y))
svmfit <- svm (y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = "linear", cost = 1e5)
summary(svmfit)
plot(svmfit, dat)
```

# Support Vector Machine

In order to fit an SVM using a non-linear kernel, we once again use the `svm()`
function. However, now we use a different value of the parameter `kernel`.
To fit an SVM with a polynomial kernel we use `kernel="polynomial"`, and
to fit an SVM with a radial kernel we use `kernel="radial"`. In the former
case we also use the `degree` argument to specify a degree for the polynomial
kernel, and in the latter case we use `gamma` to specify a
value of γ for the radial basis kernel.

We first generate some data with a non-linear class boundary, as follows:

```r
set.seed(1)
x <- matrix(rnorm(200 * 2), ncol = 2)
x[1:100, ] <- x[1:100, ] + 2
x[101:150, ] <- x[101:150, ] - 2
y <- rep(c(1, 2), c(150, 50))
dat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y))
plot(x, col = y)
```

![](/img/svm11.png)

The data is randomly split into training and testing groups. We then fit
the training data using the `svm()` function with a radial kernel and γ = 1:

```r
train <- sample(200, 100)
svmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], 
                   kernel = "radial",
                    gamma = 1,
                     cost = 1)
plot(svmfit, dat[train, ])
```

![](/img/svm12.png)

We can perform cross-validation using `tune()` to select the best choice of
γ and `cost` for an SVM with a radial kernel:

```r
set.seed(1)
tune.out <- tune(svm, y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], 
                           kernel = "radial",
                           ranges = list(cost = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),
                                        gamma = c(0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4)))
summary(tune.out)
```

![](/img/svm13.png)

Therefore, the best choice of parameters involves `cost=1` and `gamma=2`. We
can view the test set predictions for this model by applying the `predict()`
function to the data. Notice that to do this we subset the dataframe `dat`
using `-train` as an index set.

```r
table(true = dat[- train, "y"], 
      pred = predict(tune.out$best.model, newx = dat[- train, ]))
```

# ROC Curves

The `ROCR` package can be used to produce ROC curves. 
We first write a short function to plot an ROC curve
given a vector containing a numerical score for each observation, `pred`, and
a vector containing the class label for each observation, `truth`.

```r
library(ROCR)
rocplot <- function(pred, truth, ...) 
{
  predob <- prediction(pred, truth)
  perf <- performance(predob, "tpr", "fpr")
  plot(perf, ...) 
}
```

SVMs and support vector classifiers output class labels for each observation.
However, it is also possible to obtain fitted values for each observation,
which are the numerical scores used to obtain the class labels. In essence, 
the sign of the fitted value determines
on which side of the decision boundary the observation lies. Therefore, the
relationship between the fitted value and the class prediction for a given
observation is simple: if the fitted value exceeds zero then the observation
is assigned to one class, and if it is less than zero than it is assigned to the
other. In order to obtain the fitted values for a given SVM model fit, we
use `decision.values=TRUE` when fitting `svm()`. Then the `predict()` function
will output the fitted values.

```r
svmfit.opt <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], 
                       kernel = "radial",
                        gamma = 2,
                         cost = 1, 
              decision.values = T)
fitted <- attributes(predict(svmfit.opt, dat[train, ], decision.values = TRUE))$decision.values
```

Now we can produce the ROC plot.

```r
opar <- par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

rocplot(fitted, dat[train, "y"], main = "Training Data")
svmfit.flex <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat[train, ], kernel = "radial",
                         gamma = 50, cost = 1, decision.values = T)
fitted <- attributes(predict(svmfit.flex, dat[train, ], decision.values = T))$decision.values
rocplot(fitted, dat[train, "y"], add = T, col = "red")

fitted <- attributes(predict(svmfit.opt, dat[- train, ], decision.values = T))$decision.values
rocplot(fitted, dat[- train, "y"], main = "Test Data")
fitted <- attributes(predict(svmfit.flex, dat[- train, ], decision.values = T))$decision.values
rocplot(fitted, dat[- train, "y"], add = T, col = "red")

par(opar)
```

# SVM With Multiple Classes

If the response is a factor containing more than two levels, then the `svm()`
function will perform multi-class classification using the one-versus-one approach.
We explore that setting here by generating a third class of observations.

```r
set.seed(1)
x <- rbind(x, matrix(rnorm(50 * 2), ncol = 2))
y <- c(y, rep(0, 50))
x[y == 0, 2] <- x[y == 0, 2] + 2
dat <- data.frame(x = x, y = as.factor(y))
plot(x, col = (y + 1))
```

![](/img/svm15.png)

We now fit an SVM to the data:

```r
svmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = "radial", cost = 10, gamma = 1)
plot(svmfit, dat)
```

![](/img/svm16.png)

The `e1071` library can also be used to perform support vector regression,
if the response vector that is passed in to `svm()` is numerical rather than a
factor.
